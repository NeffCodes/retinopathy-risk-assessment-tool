  <div>
    <h3 class="text-xl/loose mt-2">Overview</h3>
    <p class="text-base/7">Diabetic Retinopathy is a serious eye condition caused by diabetes that affects the blood vessels in the retina. When blood sugar levels remain high over time, they can damage these vessels, potentially leading to vision problems and even blindness if left untreated.</p>
    <h3 class="text-xl/loose mt-2">Background</h3>
    <p class="text-base/7">In the early stages, diabetic retinopathy may not present any symptoms. However, as the disease progresses, it can cause significant changes in vision. Mild cases can often be managed effectively with careful diabetes management, including maintaining stable blood sugar levels. For more advanced cases, treatment options may include:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
      <li><strong>Laser Therapy:</strong> This can help to reduce the risk of severe vision loss.</li>
      <li><strong>Eye Injections:</strong> These medications can target specific issues related to retinal health.</li>
      <li><strong>Surgery:</strong> In some instances, surgical intervention may be necessary to restore vision or prevent further damage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl/loose mt-2">Prognosis</h3>
    <p class="text-base/7">The most concerning aspect of diabetic retinopathy is that it often has no early warning signs. Regular eye exams are crucial for early detection and treatment. With timely intervention, the risk of severe vision loss can be reduced by up to 95%. People with diabetes are advised to undergo a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once a year to monitor their eye health and catch any potential issues early.
