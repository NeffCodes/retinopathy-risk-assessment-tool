## Overview
The Retinopathy Risk Assessment Tool (RRAT) is a data visualization web application designed to assist clinics in the early detection and assessment of diabetic retinopathy. This tool allows medical professionals to upload patient images and input relevant patient data, receiving a detailed analysis from a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of the patient developing diabetic retinopathy.


## Features
- Image Upload: Securely upload patient retinal images for analysis.
- Patient Data Input: Add patient details such as name, date of birth, and medical history to enhance analysis accuracy.
- Model-Driven Analysis: Utilizes a trained machine learning model to assess the risk of diabetic retinopathy.
- Results Display: Presents a clear and concise prognosis, helping clinicians make informed decisions. __ __(may add onto this later regarding resources and 'what next' after prognosis i.e MayoClinci/NIH API call)__ __
